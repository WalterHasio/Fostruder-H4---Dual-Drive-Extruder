Dual motor, dual drive bowden extruder.  Uses two NEMA14 motors and two drive gears.  The two motors should be wired to run in opposite directions, and can be wired in serial or parallel (I would tend to wire the motors in series on a 24V printer and parallel on the 12V printer, but it will also depend on the motors and drivers).
